# Subway-Surfers-AI
Subway Surfers AI is a convolutional neural network trained to play the famous game of the same name, in which it is necessary to run around obstacles according to the plot. Initially, a program was written to collect training data, which during the game, after each pressing of one of the four cursor control buttons or inactivity for 0.5 seconds, took a screenshot of the screen and saved it to the appropriate folder. As a result, there were 5 folders with screenshots taken at various points in time. These images have been converted to black and white to highlight the contours of objects. Then many different network structures were created, their comparison was carried out, the best one was selected and its training was launched. After several hours, the accuracy of correct answers was about 94%. The resulting network needed about 0.2 seconds to process the image, as a result, when the main character reached high speeds, the network did not have time to make the right decision, and the game ended. The largest number of points received by the neural network, which was recorded â€“ 456025.
